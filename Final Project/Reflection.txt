What knowledge and/or skills did you learn?
  I learned the basics of Unity, and how to make a simpled platformer game. Specific topics include: enemy detection, enemy AI, enemy spawner, audio, scene management, and Unity inheritance.
  Did no use java class, learned how to script in C#, everything listed above uses scirpting, so they are the specific java classes.
  Also learned project management, and time management, as before I would try to finish coding in one sitting. In this project, I tried to code a little bit everyday and use a todo list to keep track of time.
  
  What problems did you expereince? 
    One problem that was difficult was using inheritance in Unity, since nobody really uses inheritance in Unity, so there weren't that man tutorials about that. I managed to figure it out through trail and error.
    Another problem that I faced was scene management, as the documentation really confused me, but watching tutorials with other examples helped me understand more of the code.
    Enemy AI was also quite confusing, as I had two players and the target is meant for only 1 player. I solved the error through trail and error, and usin the camera follow script which follows a similar theory.
